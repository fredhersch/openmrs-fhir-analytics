# Getting Started

FHIR Data Pipes can be installed and deployed on a number of different platforms and using different architectural patterns depending on the environment, amount of data and requirements for horizontal scalability.

The easiest way to get started is to follow the [Single Machine Deployment tutorial](tutorial_single_machine/). This uses a set of docker images and provided sample data to bring up an end-to-end environment for getting started with FHIR Data Pipes on a single machine.

You can find additional information and instructions in the following sections:

*   Using Docker Compose Configurations
*   Deploy Data Pipes "Pipelines" 
*   Deploy Data Pipes "Pipelines Controller"
