# Getting Started

In this section we will run through concepts related to FHIR Data Pipes and instructions for getting started quickly.

## FHIR Data Pipes concepts
FHIR Data Pipes provides pipelines for transforming data from a FHIR server into a Parquet format that you can use for data analysis and visualization. It can also be used to move data from one FHIR server to another. 

FHIR Data Pipes is built on technology **designed for horizontal scalability** and has multiple deployment options depending on your use case and requirements.

## Install FHIR Data Pipes
There are a number of ways to FHIR Data Pipes can be installed and deployed on a number of different platforms and using different architectural patterns depending on the environment, amount of data and requirements for horizontal scalability.

You can find additional information and instructions in the following sections:

*   Configuring the FHIR Data Pipes Pipeline and Controller
*   FHIR Data Pipes docker containers
*   Single machine deployment (for quick set-up)

Once you have set-up and deployed the FHIR Data Pipes Pipelines, you can explore different [tutorials](../tutorials.md) for working with FHIR Data Pipes.
